When using the like and notLike conditions, you provide a wildcard * in the value. The value shouldn't have more than one wildcard `*`.
When using the match and notMatch conditions, provide # to match a digit, ? for a letter, . to match any character, and any other character to match that actual character. While, match and notMatch are case-sensitive, all other conditions that evaluate a stringValue are case-insensitive. Case-insensitive alternatives are available in matchInsensitively and notMatchInsensitively.
In an `[*]` alias array field value, each element in the array is evaluated individually with logical and between elements. For more information, see Evaluating the `[*]` alias.
